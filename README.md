# calendar@cinnamon.z0rp10
This is a modified version of the offical calendar@cinnamon.org applet for Linux Cinnamon
environment.

### Why?

I wanted the day and month names to be capitalized on the applets panel-label e.g
_*Sat, 18. Jan, 23:31*_ vs _*sat, 18. jan, 23:31*_.

This is the default look when using among other UK English regional settings for Date and
 Time. But my localization settings unfortunately changed it to all lower case as per
the regional convention.

### Features
* Adds two new switches to the applets settings.
* One switch to Capitalize first letter in day and month names.
* One switch to CAPITALIZE all letters in day and month names.

### Installation
Clone or download _applet.js_ and _settings-schema.json_ from this repo and replace the two ones inside you _/usr/share/cinnamon/applets/calendar@cinnamon.org_ folder.
