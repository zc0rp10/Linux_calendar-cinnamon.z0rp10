# calendar@cinnamon.z0rp10
This is a modified version of the offical calendar@cinnamon.org applet for Linux Cinnamon
environment.

I wanted the day and month names to be capitalized on the applets panel-label e.g
_*Sat, 18. Jan, 23:31*_ vs _*sat, 18. Jan, 23:31*_.

This is the default look when using among other UK English regional settings for Date and
 Time. But my localization settings unfortunately changed it to all lower case as per
the regional convention.
